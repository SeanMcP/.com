- Show them why to care
- Teach them how to do it
- Give them the tools to do it

This past week I had the good pleasure of attending at "College & Career Day" at the local middle school. Professionals were invited to speak to groups of 7th grader students about their career and the path they took to get there.

I jumped at the opportunity to share about software development, because I was around their age when I first learned to code. Although my path to development was more circuitous than most, my initial passion for coding was kindled when I was in middle school. This was a great opportunity to try to spark that same desire in a new generation of coders.

I spent two slides talking about myself and my background, then dove straight into the main thesis:

> Software development is teaching computers to solve problems

With that frame of reference, I mentioned some of the popular games and apps of the day, all of which were created by software developers. You could watch some students perk up when they heard FortNite, TikTok, and Instagram named.

I also referenced more noble achievments like the internet, operating systems, and the software that powers artificial limbs. Then, I segued into the lesson with the following hook:

> Now we're going to learn how to teach computers to do you homework

Before planning the presentation, I looked up some of the Georgia State Standards for 7th grade in Science and Math and chose two that would be easily accomplished with a simple function: categorizing organisms by characteristics, and calculating the volume of three-dimensional shapes.

In order to do that, we needed to learn about variables and functions. I defined a variables as "a way to store information" and demonstrated how to create them with `var`. Wrapped up in this was an introduction to different data types, but I didn't take the time to elaborate.

Functions were defined as "little robots that do something when called". You can give them input, and they can return output.
