Gatsby's `gatsby-starter-blog`, [the starter from which](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog) this website was created, includes a dependency for `react-helmet`. I had never heard this library before, but it's a useful utility by the developers at the NFL for controlling the `<head>` content of generated HTML pages. You can learn more about React Helmet on [its GitHub repo](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet).
