Besides HTML and CSS, there is not programming language more ubiquitous on the modern web than JavaScript.

JavaScript was developed in the mid-1990's by Brendan Eich and build into the Netscape Navigator web browser. It was designed to be a browser-specific programming language.

JavaScript is a high-level programming language. That just means that the code is only loosely connected to the machine language that a CPU or other hardware understands. High-level languages are often easier to read and learn for beginners.

JavaScript is also an interpreted programming language. In order to run on a computer, JavaScript needs to be fed through a program called a JavaScript engine.

That JavaScript engine lives in your browser. The most popular engine, V8, is built into Google Chrome, but every major browser utilizes their own engine.

V8 is also used to power node.js, the popular JavaScript run-time environment.
