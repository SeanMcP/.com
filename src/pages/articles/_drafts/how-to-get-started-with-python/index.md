Although initially developed in the 1980s, Python has hit a renaissance in recent years. Developments in the fields of artificial intelligence and machine learning have driven interest in the language and its libraries.

I starting learning Python last year and couldn't recommend it more to developers of all levels. I wrote [_Three reasons to learn Python_](../three-reasons-to-learn-python/) to layout my argument for learning Python. Take a look if you're still on the fence.

## Let's do this... but how?

You've made the decision to learn Python (right on!), but how does one begin? We live in an age of information overload; there are websites, tutorials, guides, and recommendations every way you look. My goal is not to answer the question of "where to learn Python?" but rather "how to get started?"

I'm going to provide some useful resources for dipping your toes into the Python programming languages. The rest is up to you!

## Online sandboxes

The easiest way to start learning any programming language is in an online sandbox. For web-based languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, your options are a dime a dozen. For Python, however, there are a few sandboxes that stand out.
