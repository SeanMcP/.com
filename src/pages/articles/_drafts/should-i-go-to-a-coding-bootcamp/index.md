This past week, a friend reached out to me looking for help. He was considering quitting his job and enrolling in a full-time coding bootcamp and wanted to hear about my experience.

For those of you who don't know, I graduated from a now-defunct coding bootcamp in late 2017 before starting my first developer job in January 2018. I have a positive view of my experience and was excited that he turned to me for advice.

We set up a time to chat later that night, and I started thinking: "If I could do it all over again, would I do anything differently?" This train of thought led to the advice I gave my friend, which I will try to reiterate here.

My answer is going to be a deep dive into coding bootcamps, so let's start off with some background information.

## What is a coding bootcamp?

There are many programs that categorize themselves as coding bootcamps. In order to summarize as best I can, I'm going to paint in very broad strokes, so keep that in mind if something I mention below does not apply to the program you have in mind.

"Coding bootcamp" is a blanket term for an unaccredited post-secondary school that teaches coding fundamentals and practices, especially in a short period of time. These programs last anywhere from three months to one year depending on the scope of the content and time commitment (full-time vs. part-time).

Students receive a basic overview of many coding concepts and are required to complete daily and weekly assignments to practice those skills. Programs may emphasize group projects, pair- and mob-programming, and other common industry practices.

Graduates from these programs will usually receive a certificate of completion, which has value only as far as the institution's reputation in the community. These grads rely on the program's alumni association and/or sponsored networking events in order to land their first developer position.

Although lacking a computer science foundation, competent graduates are generally prepared for the daily work of an entry-level web/software developer position.

In Atlanta, where I live, there are a bunch of different coding bootcamps from which to choose. I'm going to refrain from referring to any in particular, because I want this article to be useful for anyone around the world who is thinking about enrolling in one.

## Why they exist

Coding bootcamps sprang up, like any good business, to fulfill a need. The early pioneers noted the growth of the tech industry world-wide. A growing industry means good business and a great opportunity for tagalong success.

Then, they counted that a certain number of workers are needed to fill roles in this growing industry. For simplicity's sake, we'll call that number `2x`.

Next, they tallied the number of computer science majors graduating from all universities around the country. That number comes out to around `x`.

The genesis of their business model came from an equation like this:

```
    2x available positions
  -  x eligible graduates
 ----------------------------
     x deficit to be filled
```

If they could create a coding school outside of the traditional university structure to meet that excess demand, then they would have a sustainable business.

And thus coding bootcamps were born.

## The sales pitch

Once the bootcamps were opened, they needed students. Enter the the enrollment officers (read: salespeople). Using the aforementioned math equation, the sales pitch for a coding bootcamp almost writes itself:

> "Tech is one of the fastest growing and highest paying industries around. In fact, there are more positions in tech available than there are traditional college grads to fill them.
>
> "If you enroll in our bootcamp, we can teach you everything you need to know to land one of those positions."

With those stats and logic in hand, combined with starting developer salary figures for your city, these enrollment officers can make a pretty convincing argument for anyone considering enrollment.

According to their figures, I would have doubled my public school teacher's salary as an entry-level developer (that didn't happen). Still, I and many others found their arguments persuasive and gave them our hard-earned money (or, more often, private loan money[^1]).

## What they don't tell you

What the admissions staff at coding bootcamps fail to mention, is that the original equation is flawed.

While it may be true that the number of open developer position exceeds the number of computer science graduates, it fails to acknowledge that not all developers/positions are fungible, a fancy word for the ability to be replaced by another identical option.

Just like in every industry, developers have different strengths, abilities, and--importantly--levels of experience.

```js
;(aBootcampGrad !== aCollegeGrad) !== aSeniorDeveloper
```

So while there is certainly a growing need for developers, there is not a vast demand for entry-level developers. There is a huge demand for experience developers, those with 5, 10, 15+ years of experience in the industry.

And that makes sense to me. If you're an established company that is looking to add a tech department of around ten employees, for what type of developers are you going to look?

You will want to cover your bases on devops, back-end, front-end, and quality assurance with mid- to senior-level hires. Maybe you'll bring on a junior-level developer but probably no more than one. That means only 10% of your job openings are open to new developers.

## Unwanted in a growing field

So the number of available entry-level jobs for bootcamp grads is drastically less than that original figure suggests. And, depending on your location, there may even be a glut--an excessive supply--of bootcamp and university grads competing for those few positions.

You may not remember much about supply and demand from Economics or History class, but know this: when employees compete at the bottom, employers win by lowering salaries and benefits. Bootcamps are unintentionally devaluing the their graduates by creating a surplus of of "junior developers."

In my experience, this was the most difficult part of my career change. I loved the coursework and the challenge that proceeded from learning something new. What crushed my soul was graduating and applying to jobs, only to see that my certificate (read: participation trophy) was worthless.

And I had it well off. I was a college graduate (Edinboro '14) with professional and development experience. Those privileges opened doors that were closed to some of my classmates. But even yet, it was a challenge and not in the "fun and exciting" way.

To be fair, my coding bootcamp did close immediately after our cohort's graduation. But I have heard similar experiences from other graduates programs. Just search around for ["coding bootcamp reviews"](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=coding+bootcamp+reviews&t=hj&ia=web) from graduates; they aren't pretty.

## Be realistic about your prospects

Reading all that, you might think that I dislike coding bootcamps. In truth, I don't. I think they can be a wonderful way to empower individuals to start a new career in an exciting industry.

But I do think that their pitch deck is leading, perhaps intentionally so. It will be incredibly difficult to land a developer position after graduating from a coding bootcamp. So be realistic about your job prospects and take that into account when making your decision.

There are some bootcamps that forgo tuition until you receive your first developer position. I like this idea in principle but be wary. This means the bootcamp has a vested interest in getting you a job--any job--as quickly as possible, so that they get paid.

Are they going to be looking out for your best interest or theirs? That depends on the company, team, and individual with whom you will be working. Just keep all that in mind.

## Bootcamps will prepare you for a job; they will not get you a job

## So, should you go to a coding bootcamp?

The answer is: "It depends".
